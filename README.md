# Spatial Analysis w R in Power BI: Mapping U.S. Census Data

## Prologue: The Speaker
Who am I?
Who do I work for?
What expertise do I have with this subject?


What is Spatial Analysis?
What's the difference between mapping data and performing geospatial analysis?
Geocomputing with R comes in handy here
What other R spatial analysis resouces can I use?

What Will You Expect to Learn?
Introduction to most popular R packages for geospatial that work in Power BI
Overview of introductory geospatial analysis 

What I won't go through in this presentation
Shape files
Review all the R packages used for spatial analysis
Advanced Machine Learning with spatial data

## Part I: The Tools

Why is R so Popular?

R and Geospatial Analysis
Why Use R for Spatial Analysis? => Geocomputing with R will answer this
Present a gallery of R maps and geospatial analysis that could be possible in Power BI

Why Should I Use R with Power BI?
	• Power Query
	• R Visual

What Are the Popular R Geospatial Packages?
	• ggplot2
	• maps
	
Current Power BI Geospatial Visuals
	• Esri ArcGIS Maps
	• Mapbox
	• Bing Maps
	• Shape Maps
	• Custom Visual from Gallery

Popular R Geospatial Packages that work with Power BI
	• Desktop
	• Power BI Service

## Part II: The Data

What is spatial data? How do I know I have spatial data?
Why limit ourselves to United States data?
Might be useful to compare tidycensus and other R Census API packages

Why Focus on U.S. Census API?
	• What is it?
	• What data does it contain?
	• What types of analysis can I perform with the data?
	
	• How do I connect to it? => PowerCensus
	• What do I do once I have the data?

## Part III: The Analysis
Types of Spatial Analysis => Geocomputing with R

Gentle introduction to clustering and other 

## Part IV: A Demonstration

## Part V: Limitations
Look at David Eversveld Top 10 and Top 5 Maps with Power BI
